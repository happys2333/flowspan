# Flowspan Test Strategy

## 1. Evidence model

No single test layer proves Flowspan. Release evidence records the command,
commit, OS/architecture, runner or hardware, result, and artifact link. Results
are classified as:

- **Local**: executed on the current developer machine;
- **CI**: executed on a named hosted runner image;
- **Real machine**: executed with the relevant native permissions and hardware;
- **Simulated/contract**: proves portable logic or adapter conformance, not a
  platform API itself.

A result in one class never silently substitutes for another.

## 2. Mandatory layers

| Layer | Purpose | Required examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Formatting/build | deterministic, warning-free source | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes`, Release build |
| Unit | value objects and local transitions | descriptor validation, capability sets, leases |
| Model/property | broad transition sequences and invariants | operation idempotency, swap atomicity, lease epochs |
| Protocol contract | stable codec/version behavior | golden fixtures, unknown/required fields, limits |
| Integration | multiple real components through in-memory ports | two-node handoff/move/swap/mirror |
| Fault injection | safety at every I/O boundary | drop, duplicate, reorder, delay, disconnect, journal failure |
| Security negative | reject hostile or unauthorized behavior | key change, replay, bad grant, malformed frames, redaction |
| Platform contract | every native adapter follows common semantics | denied permission, protected surface, emergency stop |
| Native smoke/e2e | actual APIs and packaging | matching Windows/macOS/Linux runners and machines |
| UI/accessibility | user-visible state and controls | keyboard flows, accessible labels, no color-only state |

## 3. Deterministic simulator

The simulator owns a virtual monotonic clock and seeded schedule. Network events
are explicit (`deliver`, `drop`, `duplicate`, `disconnect`) and every node owns
an independent journal. Failing tests print the seed and minimized event trace.
No property test depends on wall-clock sleeps.

DNS-SD tests keep the third-party packet stack behind an injected record
boundary. Core tests cover canonical TXT limits, hostile randomized payloads,
current-trust binding, dual-stack address selection, expiry, and removal.
Adapter tests cover split SRV/TXT/A/AAAA arrival, batch/cache bounds, package
record translation, full-stack restart on network change, and injected
bind/factory/diagnostic failures. Publisher tests cover canonical minimized
profiles, immediate publication, fresh-nonce refresh, cancellation withdrawal,
failure preservation (including simultaneous startup/cleanup failure),
network-stack replay, old-stack cleanup recovery, and failed-publish rollback.
These are contract tests; only the manual two-device matrix may be labelled
physical multicast evidence.

Inbound-listener integration tests open one real loopback TCP listener and
authenticate two different current trust records through the same port. Negative
and fault tests reject an unknown peer without poisoning the next accept, prove
that a claimed Device ID cannot substitute another key, enforce the default and
hard concurrency limits with slot backpressure, isolate handler failure, reject
missing capabilities, and drain the correct sessions on peer revocation, caller
cancellation, or fatal accept failure. Fake accept/session ports make failure
ordering deterministic. These tests prove the bounded listener contract only;
they do not prove physical two-device networking, firewall behavior, or remote
interface reachability.

Core invariants are asserted after every event:

1. a move never removes the only acknowledged instance;
2. aborted/uncommitted swap leaves original placements;
3. terminal outcomes do not change;
4. operation ID/digest is one-to-one;
5. at most one live driver lease epoch authorizes input;
6. unauthorized peers never observe descriptor content;
7. diagnostics contain no registered canary secret.

## 4. CI matrix

Pull requests and protected branches run:

| Job | OS | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-linux` | `ubuntu-latest` | restore, format, Release build, all portable tests |
| `test-windows` | `windows-latest` | Release build, portable and Windows contract/native-safe tests |
| `test-macos` | `macos-latest` | Release build, portable and macOS contract/native-safe tests |
| `security` | Ubuntu | dependency audit, secret scan, CodeQL/static analysis where supported |
| `packages` | all three | produce installable unsigned test artifacts and smoke launch |

The SDK is installed from `global.json`; dependencies are locked and caches key
on lock files. Tests use invariant culture/time zone unless testing localization.
Native permission tests that hosted runners cannot grant are skipped only with a
stable reason code and appear in the evidence summary—not as passes.

## 5. Protocol compatibility policy

- Committed golden fixtures are decoded by the current reader.
- Current writers round-trip through the current reader canonically.
- The oldest supported minor fixture is included in every run.
- Required-field removal or semantic reuse requires a major version.
- Optional additions need old-reader behavior tests.
- Fuzz and hostile fixtures have bounded execution time and allocations.

## 6. Quality thresholds

Coverage percentages are diagnostic, not the acceptance target. All safety
invariants and error branches for pairing, authorization, move, swap, lease,
frame decoding, redaction, and emergency stop require explicit tests. New code
may not reduce branch coverage for those namespaces. Flaky tests are treated as
failures; quarantining requires an owner, issue, and expiry.

## 7. Manual evidence before v1

On at least one supported version of each OS:

- install, upgrade, uninstall, and launch at login;
- discover and pair two physical devices on a LAN;
- permission grant, denial, revocation, and subsequent recovery;
- semantic handoff plus visibly labelled Remote Window fallback;
- capture/input protection on sensitive surfaces;
- emergency stop under network loss and UI stress;
- sleep/wake, Wi-Fi change, peer restart, and version mismatch;
- screen reader, keyboard-only operation, scaling, reduced motion;
- artifact signing/notarization verification.

These results are recorded under `artifacts/evidence/<version>/` or linked from
the release record. The repository must not claim them before execution.
